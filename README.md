## Video Web Restructuring Version

English | [简体中文](README_zh-CN.md)

This is the Refactored version of the [Video Web](https://github.com/EmbraceTheLight/VideoWeb) project.

I will use many new technologies and tools to refactor the project, and I will also add new features to make it more powerful and user-friendly.

The biggest change is that I use the go-kratos framework to refactor the project. It is a microservice framework that is easy to use and has a high degree of scalability.
